# puzzles
This repository contains coding puzzes of varying difficulty, grouped together
into directories that reflect their difficulty level. Each file is totally self
sufficient and contains a description of the task, a solution and multiple
tests that ensure the solution is correct.

Puzzles in this repository are implemented using a wide variety of programming
languages (e.g. C, C++, Java, etc). All files are completely stand alone and
compile without issues using popular compilers for each language (e.g. gcc,
g++, javac, etc).
